# Here's P2 Password Generator

Here's my attempt at making a redneck name passwurd gen'rater. 

It's still a bit buggy but I got most of the functionality to work. I had a hard time getting the $_GET variables passed to the php, I'm sure there's a more elegant way of makeing it work. In the password generator, I couldn't figure out how to delete the blank spaces that were being added (are they being added by line breaks in the file?) and getting the symbols to appear (would I need to make them html entities?).

My original thought was to create the password using southern 'wurds" and have a translation, and it used in a sentence below but I couldn't figure out how to make the array with three associated values. I rekoned I could use a csv file to create the array but as it turned out I ran out of time to try this. 

In the end I just wanted to get it working and simplified my approach. It was amazing how much time it took me to get the name file (and formatting the other file that I didn't use). Lesson learned: keep it simple and add on later.
