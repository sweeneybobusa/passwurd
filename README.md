# Here's P2 Password Generator

It's still a bit buggy but I got most of the functionality to work. I had a hard time getting the passed files to populate. In the password generator, I couldn't figure out how to delete the blank spaces and the special symbols to show up. would I need to make them html entities? and is it the line breaks that might cause the extra space? One other thing I wanted to do was to use a term file where I had a word, it's translation, and the word used in a sentence, but I ran out of time trying to figure out how to get them to work. I figured I could use a csv file and have it fill an array but didn't see how I could get it all to fill in one array.

In the end I just wanted to get it working and simplified. It was amazing how much time it took me to get the name file (and formatting the other file that I didn't use). Lesson learned: keep it simple and add on later.
